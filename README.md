# odin-landing-page

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It contains a single page, however the stylization was applied to it using CSS in accordance to the given page style template (in a form of pictures [1](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and [2](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png)). Both index.html and style.css files were written for the project.

During the development of this project, the following was used:
- Knowledge of HTML acquired during development of the [previous project](https://github.com/bulkassi/odin-recipes)
- New knowledge of CSS for page stylization, including Cascade, HTML and CSS inspection, Box Model and Flexbox (growing, shrinking, alignment)

All images used in this project belong not to me, but to their respective owners.
